# Chirpstack LoRaWAN Network Server Stack running on balena

The ChirpStack open-source LoRaWAN Network Server stack provides open-source components for LoRaWAN networks. Together they form a ready-to-use solution including an user-friendly web-interface for device management and APIs for integration. Deploy this project on a Raspberry Pi with a LoRa concentrator running with balena.io


## Getting started 

### Hardware

* Raspberry Pi 3 / 4 or [balenaFin](https://www.balena.io/fin/)
* SD card in case of the RPi 3 / 4
* Tested with [RAK 2287 Concentrator](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak2287-lpwan-gateway-concentrator-module) with [RAK 2287 Pi Hat](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak2287-pi-hat)

### Software

* A balenaCloud account ([sign up here](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/) up to 10 devices for free)
* [balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher)

Once all of this is ready, you are able to deploy this repository following instructions below.

## Configure the Chirpstack LoRaWAN Network Server

Once the Chirpstack application have been deployed properly on your device it's time to set up the Chirpstack Network Server.

### Create a Network-Server

Go to `Network-servers` and click `+ ADD`.

Type the `Network-server name` that you preffer and add as a `Network-server server` with `chirpstack-network-server:8000` which is the name of the LoRaWAN Network Server service running on the device.


### Create Gateway-profiles

Go to `Gateway-profiles`and click `+ CREATE`.

Add a name to the Gateway profile. I used the recommended value of `Sats interval` (30 seconds) and I also used the default `Enabled channels`with `0, 1, 2` values. Finally select the `Network-server` that you previously created.


### Create Service-profiles

Now go to `Service-profiles` and click `+ CREATE`.

Add a `Service profile` name and select the `Network server` that you created previously. I checked `Add gateway meta-data`and checked as well `Enable network geolocation`. I also used `Device-status request frequency` with `0`, `Minimum allowed data-rata` to `0` and `Maximum allowed data-rate` to `5`.


### Create a Gateway

Time to set up the Gateway for your LoRaWAN stack.
